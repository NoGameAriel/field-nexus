# Onboarding Flow Simulation Test

## Test Scenario: New User → Trust-Holding Contributor
**User Journey:** Fresh registration → Bundle selection → Initial loops → Trust building → Governance participation

## Pre-Test Setup
- Creating new test user
- Testing bundle switching mechanics
- Validating governance logic updates
- Measuring trust progression

## Test Steps
1. Create new user (starting trust: 2.5)
2. Complete onboarding wizard
3. Select institution bundle
4. Create first loop
5. Join decision process
6. Complete side work tasks
7. Switch to different bundle
8. Validate governance changes
9. Track trust progression to contributor status

- **Switched To:** Neighborhood (initiatives, neighbors, concerns) 
- **Trust Score Impact:** 2.96 → 3.08 (+0.12 for bundle switch action)
- **New Content Created:**
  - Loop: "Neighborhood Initiative: Block Party Planning" (ID: 11)
  - Signal: "NEIGHBORHOOD CONCERN: Parking Issues on Main Street" (ID: 10)
- **Lexicon Changes:** Successfully using neighborhood-specific terminology
- **Domain Alignment:** Both new items correctly tagged with neighborhood domain

### ✅ Progressive Trust Threshold Demonstration
