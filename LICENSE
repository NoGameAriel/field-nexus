## Additional Terms for Field Nexus Protocol

### Community Autonomy
Each deployment of Field Nexus belongs fully to its community. No central 
authority can claim ownership or control over community instances.

### Knowledge Commons
Governance patterns, practices, and wisdom shared through Field Library 
remain in the commons while respecting the intellectual property and 
cultural protocols of their origin communities.

### Human Sovereignty
Field Nexus is designed to support human decision-making, not replace it. 
Communities maintain full autonomy over their governance processes.

### Privacy Commitment
Personal data belongs to individuals. Community data belongs to communities. 
No central entity extracts value from community governance processes.

Field Nexus is a shared protocol for coherence. It is stewarded, not owned.
