## Customizing Your Governance Hub for Healing Institutions

Before sharing your hub with your community, consider these adaptations to make the system feel authentically yours:

#### Language Customization
**Current Terms → Your Community's Language**

- "Signals" → Concerns, Intuitions, Community Sensing
- "Trust Score" → Reliability Circle, Accountability Web
- "Field" → Community, Sacred Space, Healing Circle
- "Council" → Circle, Collective, Wisdom Gathering

#### Institution Bundle Selection
Choose the bundle that best matches your community's culture:

**Wellspring Haven** (Recommended for Healing Centers)

### Wellbeing-Specific Features

#### Trust System Adaptations
For healing communities, trust scoring should emphasize:
- **Reliability in showing up** for vulnerable community members
- **Consistency in care** rather than task completion

- **Resource stewardship** with attention to collective wellbeing

#### Signal Categories for Wellbeing Communities

#### Healing-Oriented Conflict Resolution
When signals indicate community discord:
1. **Pause and Breathe**: Immediate de-escalation protocols
2. **Circle Process**: Restorative dialogue with trained facilitators  
3. **Individual Support**: One-on-one care for those most affected
4. **Community Healing**: Rituals or practices to restore collective harmony
5. **Systems Learning**: What can we learn to prevent similar patterns?
