# 🔁 Field Nexus | Civic Operating System

**A decentralized protocol for planetary regeneration**

Field Nexus enables any community, cooperative, or collective to govern themselves through loops of trust, signal-based feedback, and shared resource coherence. It replaces hierarchy with stewardship, scoring with relational resonance, and extraction with cultural trust loops.

## 🌍 Purpose

This is not a SaaS product. This is a protocol for planetary regeneration that any community can deploy autonomously while participating in a global federated network of governance knowledge.

### Core Transformation
- **Replace Hierarchy** → With stewardship and distributed decision-making
- **Replace Scoring** → With relational resonance and trust loops  
- **Replace Extraction** → With cultural trust and regenerative patterns

## 🛡️ Ethical Principles

### Human Sovereignty
- AI supports but never replaces human discernment and consent
- All AI-generated content includes transparency labels and reject/reframe options
- Communities maintain full autonomy over their governance processes

### Privacy by Default
- Personal coherence tools default to private
- Field-level feedback loops, not individual surveillance  
- Sharing is voluntary and sacred, never extracted

### Trust Through Dialogue
- Qualitative trust states (Rooted 🌿, Emerging 🌱, Dormant 💤, Tending 🔧)
- No numeric scoring or gamification
- Relational trust earned through live dialogue and shared action
