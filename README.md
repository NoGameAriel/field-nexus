# Field Nexus | Civic Operating System

**A decentralized protocol for planetary regeneration**

Field Nexus enables any community, cooperative, or collective to govern themselves through loops of trust, signal-based feedback, and shared resource coherence. It replaces hierarchy with stewardship, scoring with relational resonance, and extraction with cultural trust loops.

## Purpose

This is not a SaaS product. This is a protocol for planetary regeneration that any community can deploy autonomously while participating in a global federated network of governance knowledge.

### Core Transformation
- **Replace Hierarchy** → With stewardship and distributed decision-making
- **Replace Scoring** → With relational resonance and trust loops  
- **Replace Extraction** → With cultural trust and regenerative patterns

## Quick Start

### Federated Deployment
- Each Field Nexus instance is fully autonomous and community-owned
- Optional knowledge sharing with global network
- Privacy-first design with no centralized data collection

##  Ethical Principles

### Human Sovereignty
- AI supports but never replaces human discernment and consent
- All AI-generated content includes transparency labels and reject/reframe options
- Communities maintain full autonomy over their governance processes

### Privacy by Default
- Personal coherence tools default to private
- Field-level feedback loops, not individual surveillance  
- Sharing is voluntary and sacred, never extracted

### Trust Through Dialogue
- Qualitative trust states (Rooted 🌿, Emerging 🌱, Dormant 💤, Tending 🔧)
- No numeric scoring or gamification
- Relational trust earned through live dialogue and shared action

## Deployment Requirements

### System Requirements
- Node.js 18+ 
- PostgreSQL database
- 1GB RAM minimum
- SSL certificate for production

### Environment Variables

**Important**: Field Nexus is a shared protocol for coherence. It is stewarded, not owned. Each deployment is autonomous and belongs fully to its community.

## Acknowledgments

Field Nexus emerged from the lived experience of communities worldwide seeking to transition from hierarchical to regenerative governance. Special appreciation to:

- Indigenous governance traditions that inspire our patterns
- Cooperatives and collectives sharing their coordination wisdom
- Open source communities modeling collaborative development
- Every community brave enough to experiment with post-hierarchical organizing
