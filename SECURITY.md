# Security Policy

Field Nexus takes security seriously to protect communities using our governance protocol. This document outlines our security practices and how to report vulnerabilities.

## 🛡️ Security Philosophy

### Privacy by Design
- Personal data defaults to private
- Community data belongs to the community
- No central data collection or surveillance
- Optional sharing with explicit consent

### Human Sovereignty
- Communities maintain full control over their data
- No backdoors or administrative overrides
- Transparent security practices
- User-controlled access permissions

## 🔒 Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x     | ✅ Yes             |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No              |

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Immediate Response Required
For critical vulnerabilities that could impact community safety or privacy:

**Email**: security@fieldnexus.org (24-hour response commitment)
**PGP Key**: [Available on request]

### Standard Vulnerabilities
For general security issues:

1. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting
2. **Email**: security@fieldnexus.org
3. **Encrypted Communication**: Signal or Matrix available on request

### What to Include
- **Description**: Clear explanation of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed reproduction steps
- **Impact Assessment**: Potential harm to communities
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for resolution
- **Disclosure Timeline**: Your preferred timeline for public disclosure

## 🔍 Security Measures

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: All data encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3)
- **Database Security**: Encrypted at rest, secure connection strings
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with PostgreSQL
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated and sanitized

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing with salt
- **Session Security**: Secure session tokens, HTTP-only cookies
- **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions for community resources
- **API Security**: Rate limiting and request validation

### Infrastructure Security
- **Dependency Management**: Regular updates and vulnerability scanning
- **Environment Variables**: Secure secrets management
- **HTTPS Only**: Force secure connections in production
- **CORS Configuration**: Appropriate cross-origin policies

### Privacy Protections
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary data
- **Retention Limits**: Automatic cleanup of old session data
- **User Rights**: Full data export and deletion capabilities
- **Transparency**: Clear privacy policy and data practices

## 🛠️ Security Best Practices for Deployments

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# Use strong random secrets
SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)

# Secure database connections
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db?sslmode=require

# Production environment
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Database Security
- Use managed PostgreSQL with SSL
- Regular backups with encryption
- Restricted network access
- Strong authentication credentials

### Deployment Security
- HTTPS/TLS certificates (Let's Encrypt recommended)
- Regular security updates
- Firewall configuration
- Monitor access logs

### Community Guidelines
- **Strong Passwords**: Encourage good password practices
- **Secure Devices**: Guidelines for accessing Field Nexus safely
- **Phishing Awareness**: Education about social engineering
- **Regular Backups**: Community data backup recommendations

## 🔧 Security Updates

### Update Process
1. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Evaluate severity and impact
2. **Fix Development**: Develop and test security patches
3. **Community Notification**: Alert communities about critical updates
4. **Coordinated Disclosure**: Work with reporters on public disclosure

### Update Channels
- **GitHub Releases**: Security patches tagged clearly
- **Security Advisories**: GitHub security advisory system
- **Community Notifications**: Email to deployment contacts
- **Documentation Updates**: Security guide updates

## 🤝 Responsible Disclosure

### Timeline
- **Initial Response**: 24 hours for critical, 72 hours for standard
- **Assessment**: 1 week for impact evaluation
- **Fix Development**: 2-4 weeks depending on complexity
- **Public Disclosure**: Coordinated with reporter, typically 90 days

### Recognition
Security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities will be:
- Credited in security advisories (with permission)
- Listed in our security hall of fame
- Offered opportunity to review fixes before release

## 🚫 Out of Scope

### Not Considered Security Issues
- **Feature Requests**: Suggestions for new security features
- **Governance Disputes**: Community conflicts or disagreements
- **Social Engineering**: Attacks targeting individual users
- **Third-party Services**: Vulnerabilities in external dependencies
- **Physical Security**: Server or device physical access

### Known Limitations
- **Community Responsibility**: Some security depends on community practices
- **Third-party Integrations**: Security limited by external service practices
- **User Education**: Social engineering prevention requires user awareness
