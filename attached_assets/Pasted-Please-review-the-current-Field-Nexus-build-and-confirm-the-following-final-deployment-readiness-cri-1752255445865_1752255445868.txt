Please review the current Field Nexus build and confirm the following final deployment readiness criteria:

---

1. Field Agreement is active and required before major actions (loop creation, voting, etc.)
2. AI-generated prompts and suggestions are clearly labeled and include the option to reject or reframe.
3. Personal coherence tools (Private Journal, Side Work) default to private visibility.
4. Trust, reputation, and coherence mechanisms do not use numeric scores or public grading.
5. The Field Ethos (mirror > rubric, sovereignty > scoring) is visible in the footer or onboarding.
