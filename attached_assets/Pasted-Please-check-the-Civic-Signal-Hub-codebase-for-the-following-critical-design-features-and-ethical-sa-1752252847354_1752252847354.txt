Please check the Civic Signal Hub codebase for the following critical design features and ethical safeguards based on July 10th updates:

1. **Field Agreement Modal**
   - Confirm it's shown at first login AND before initiating key actions (e.g., loop creation, voting, invitations).
   - Confirm the agreement stores a `fieldAgreementSigned: true` flag per user.
   - Confirm the language is reflective, not legalistic.

2. **Reframe of Scoring to Field Reflections**
   - Trust Score should now be named "Signal Integrity"
   - Coherence Score should be renamed "Field Pulse" or similar
   - Ensure no numerical grades are publicly shown for individuals

3. **Private Self-Check Tools**
   - Self-reflection or health tools must default to private mode
   - Confirm presence of a toggle:  
     `Would you like to share this? [ ] Yes [x] No`
   - Ensure user reflection data is never auto-shared or indexed

4. **Trust and Fairness Circles (Human-led)**
   - Check that automated ranking systems are **disabled or removed**
   - Confirm templates or routes for:
     - Loop Reflection Summary
     - Hosting Trust Circles
   - Ensure trust or fairness metrics are only surfaced via voluntary, human-led input

5. **AI Transparency**
   - AI-generated prompts must include labels like:  
     `This was suggested by pattern recognition. You may discard.`
   - Confirm user interface includes reject/edit/discard options

6. **“Lean-In” Feature**
   - Confirm presence of “Lean In” button on user dashboard
   - Options should include:
     - Add side work
     - Ask for sanctuary
     - View open loops
     - Reconnect with pod

7. **Tone and Language Softening**
   - Replace all instances of “scoring,” “task tracking,” or “performance” with:
     - “Reflection,” “Signal,” “Loop,” or “Field Pulse”
   - Dashboard titles should center the **field**, not the individual

8. **Field Ethos Display**
   - Confirm the presence of a visible field ethos (e.g., in footer, modal, or onboarding)
   - Example quote:  
     `This is a mirror, not a rubric. We reflect. We repair. We don’t surveil.`

Please summarize any missing, partially implemented, or out-of-alignment features based on this list.
