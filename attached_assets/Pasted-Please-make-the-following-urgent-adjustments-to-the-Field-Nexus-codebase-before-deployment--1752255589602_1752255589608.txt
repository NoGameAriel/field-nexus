Please make the following urgent adjustments to the Field Nexus codebase before deployment:

---

🚨 1. TRUST SYSTEM ETHICAL FIX (BLOCKER)

Update the TrustSystem component to **remove all numerical scoring** (e.g. 2.4, 3.1) and **replace with qualitative trust states**.

❏ Replace numeric values with 4 visual/semantic states:
- "Rooted" → stable, consistent care
- "Emerging" → new or low signal participant
- "Dormant" → inactive or paused
- "Tending" → currently rebuilding trust via side work

❏ Display via:
- Icons (e.g. 🌱, 🌿, 💤, 🔧)
- Colors or pulsing glow (optional)
- Tooltip or hover: “This trust state is based on voluntary field activity, not a score.”

❏ Ensure **trust state is visible only to the user and their pod**, NOT globally public

---

🌀 2. REPLICATION SYSTEM PLACEHOLDERS (Add before deployment)

❏ Create new route/page: `/replication` with placeholder guide text:
- Title: “Start a New Nexus”
- Section: “How to Replicate This Hub”
- Add a simple checklist or call to action
- Optional markdown viewer for documentation import

❏ Create new component: `ActiveDomainTracker.tsx`
- Displays basic list of system domains (e.g. Trust, Care, Resources)
- Each shows:
   - Loops active in domain (placeholder number)
   - Button: “Mark domain as Frozen / Active”
   - Last update timestamp (hardcoded or simulated for now)

❏ Create placeholder page: `/transparency-digest`
- Displays:
   - Funding flow summary (mocked)
   - Pod contributions
   - Top loop activity this cycle
   - Placeholder “Coming Soon” badge

❏ Link these 3 new features in dashboard footer or internal nav panel for internal use

---

🧭 3. LANDING PAGE CLEANUP (Low Priority)

❏ If `Landing.tsx` is not routed, either:
- Delete the file
- Or route it to `/welcome` and turn it into a public intro page (Field Ethos, Invitation to Join, Overview)

---

Please return a confirmation once:
- TrustSystem no longer displays numeric scores
- Replication route and components exist
- Transparency Digest is scaffolded
- Landing.tsx is either removed or properly routed
