/**
 * üîÅ FIELD NEXUS | CIVIC OPERATING SYSTEM
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 * This codebase supports the deployment of a decentralized civic protocol that enables 
 * any community, cooperative, or collective to govern themselves through loops of trust, 
 * signal-based feedback, and shared resource coherence.
 *
 * It replaces hierarchy with stewardship.
 * It replaces scoring with relational resonance.
 * It replaces extraction with cultural trust loops.
 * 
 * This is not a SaaS product. This is a protocol for planetary regeneration.
 *

 *
 * 1. Enable any community (local or digital) to launch their own Field Nexus hub.
 * 2. Guide them through cultural adaptation (governance pattern selection, loop definitions).
 * 3. Maintain ethical integrity (privacy-first, no scoring, full human sovereignty).
 * 4. Support network emergence through optional federation scaffolding.
 * 5. Route serious inquiries to Ariel (arcanastrategies@gmail.com) for guided onboarding.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------

 * - Full field agreement onboarding (4-step civic covenant)
 * - Loop Ledger, Trust (qualitative), Signal Pathways, Resource sharing, Ritual system
 * - Multi-language support (i18n-ready)

 *
 * ------------------------------------------
 * üß≠ INSTRUCTIONS FOR MAINTAINERS:

 * 4. Replace any ownership language with ‚Äústewardship‚Äù or ‚Äúparticipation.‚Äù
 * 5. Add a dynamic global library route `/field-library` to enable knowledge exchange.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------
 * üå± FUTURE VERSIONS MAY INCLUDE:
 * - ActivityPub federation for cross-field coherence
 * - AI field-tracking (only if sovereignty-safe)
 * - Public field ripple visualizer
