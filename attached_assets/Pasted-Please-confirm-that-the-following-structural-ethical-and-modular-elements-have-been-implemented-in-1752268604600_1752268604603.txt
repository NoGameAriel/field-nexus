Please confirm that the following structural, ethical, and modular elements have been implemented in the Field Nexus system, in alignment with the intended framing as a decentralized, globally-adaptable civic protocol:

---

🛡️ 1. Stewardship + Ethical Structure

❏ Field Agreement is integrated and required before initiating loops, decisions, or public sharing  
❏ AI suggestions are always labeled, ignorable, and non-binding  
❏ No numeric trust scores are visible—trust is displayed using qualitative states only  
❏ Personal coherence tools (e.g. Journal, Side Work) default to private visibility  
❏ Field Ethos is visible in the system (footer, welcome screen, or settings)

---

🌐 2. Global Decentralization Readiness

❏ System contains no hardcoded cultural language that would prevent global/local adaptation  
❏ All field categories (petals, domains) are editable or configurable by hub initiators  
❏ Public-facing text (especially onboarding, agreement, dashboard) avoids region-locked assumptions  
❏ Replication Guide is accessible or scaffolded at `/replication` route

---

🧬 3. Field Charter & Open Framework

❏ Placeholder or structure exists for a “Field Charter” page or modal (can be static)  
❏ References to ownership, control, or central authority have been removed from system labels and logic  
❏ Footer or About section contains clear language:  
   _“Field Nexus is a shared protocol for coherence. It is stewarded, not owned.”_

---

🧺 4. Modularity for Institutional Use

❏ Components are structured as modular cards or renderable objects (e.g., LoopCard, SignalCard, DomainCard)  
❏ Role-based visibility is supported (pods, stewards, initiators)  
❏ Clear entry points exist for schools, pods, or collectives to host their own instance (or fork)

---

📡 5. Federation/Hub Readiness

❏ Active Domain Tracker is present and shows which fields/systems are alive or frozen  
❏ Transparency Digest page exists or is scaffolded  
❏ Placeholder for “Field Comparison View” is ready or noted for future development

---

Please return a summary noting:
- ✅ Which of these are currently implemented
- 🟡 Which are in placeholder/mock form
- ❌ Which are not yet addressed and would need to be removed from announcement language

Once these items are verified, the system will be safe to frame publicly as a decentralized, replicable, ethically-governed global civic tool.
